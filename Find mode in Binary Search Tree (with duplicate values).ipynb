    "\n",
    "Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume a BST is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.\n",
    "The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.\n",
    "Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "Given BST [1,null,2,2],\n",

    "Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.\n",
