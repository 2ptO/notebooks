    "Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n",

    " ```\n",
    "Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.\n",
