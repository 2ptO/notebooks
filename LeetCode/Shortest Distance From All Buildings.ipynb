    "### [Shortest Distance from all buildings](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-from-all-buildings/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:\n",
    "\n",

    "Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.\n",

    "**Output:** 7 \n",

    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2), the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7."
