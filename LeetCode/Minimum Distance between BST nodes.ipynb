    "\n",
    "Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.\n",

    "Example :\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:\n",

    "        /   \\\n",

    "     / \\    \n",
    "    1   3  \n",
    "\n",
    "while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.\n",
    "The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different."
