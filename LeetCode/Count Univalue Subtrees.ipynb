    "## Notes\n",
    "This one turned out to be little tricky. The question was not clear at the beginning. I had to run through some sample cases to understand the ask here. Once the base cases are identified, it became relatively easier to implement. I made a mistake of returning the univalues through recursion. Learnt that such approach may not work in all problems. For some problems, simple traversal may do the trick. For problems like these, I should have found out the use of post-order traversal as and when the base cases are identified because we update univalue of a node only after updating the univalue of the child nodes. Nonetheless, this was a good learning exercise. Retouched the post-order traversal techniques (recursion and iterative with two-stack and single stack) and also python dictionary basics.\n",
