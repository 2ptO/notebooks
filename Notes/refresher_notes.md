  - [ ] Big O, Omega, Theta notations, derivations
  - [Big O cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

## Language

- My choice of language: Python. See some refresher vides from this [link](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/programming-language-resources.md)
- [Python Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/python-cheat-sheet-v1.pdf)
- [ ] Add reference to my own cheat sheet and Python specific notes
- [Complexity in Python](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/lectures/complexitypython.txt)
- [ ] There was another link too. Add that one here.
