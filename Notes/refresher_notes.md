- [ ] Computer Networking 
- [ ] Storage protocols, applications, pros and cons
- [ ] File system concepts
- [ ] OOP
- [ ] Algorithmic Analysis
  - [ ] Asymptotic Notation
  - [ ] Big O, Omega, Theta notations, derivations

## Language

- My choice of language: Python. See some refresher vides from this [link](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/programming-language-resources.md)]
- [Python Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/python-cheat-sheet-v1.pdf)
- [ ] Add reference to my own cheat sheet and Python specific notes
