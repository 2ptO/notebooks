# All Things Open 2018

![ATO-Logo](images/ATO-Logo.jpg)

Attended my first All Things Open conference this year. Almost every major hot tech trend had a breakout session. Kubernetes and ML based topics topped the charts though. At times it was difficult to pick the talk due to multiple conflicts. I attended two workshops and several other independent talks on different tracks. Some turned out to be super interesting and some so-so. My top picks: Building WhereML, Raspberry Pi for devs and makers, keynote sessions on both days, some parts of OSS contribution workshop and Observability at Expedia. Lots of valuable takeaways from this conference.
